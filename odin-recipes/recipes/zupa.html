    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's a chilly Sunday evening and the sun is beginning to set. You are in the kitchen with your old, hunched over Italian grandmother.
            This is her natural habitat, you are simply along for the ride. There is a small, bubbling cauldron
            on the stove top above a large, flickering flame. You take a whiff of the warm, steam-filled air 
            emanating from the big pot. The flavorful gas particles floating from the pot and into your nose 
            bring you a vision of a window in the kitchen of a small bungalow on the shores of Naples, overlooking a 
            gentle tide. This is being brought upon you by the pleasant odor of a Zupa di Pesce in progress, full of noble sea fruit who 
            have done nothing short of sacrificing their souls for your potent, momentary enjoyment, derived 
            from nothing other than the physical contact of their mortal forms upon the microscopic buds
            that comprise the moist and delicate sensor within the mouth that is too often taken for granted - the almighty tongue. The sea fruit 
            within this bubbling vessel are nothing other than fresh scallops, shrimp, calamari, mussels, and clams,
            adorned with olive oil and tomatoes, garlic, and fresh herbs straight from your grandmother's garden,
            finished off by resting atop a nest of hand-rolled linguine pasta, eager to satisfy your taste. This 
            classic never fails to make Tony drool uncontrollably.</p>

        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir sea scallops, shrimp, and calamari rings in the hot oil until scallops and calamari are opaque and shrimp are pink, about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Bring a separate pot of water to a boil and add mussels and littleneck clams to the boiling water; cook until shells have opened, about 3 minutes. Remove shellfish and rinse with hot water.</li>

            <li>Pour crushed tomatoes, water, 2 cans chopped clams, 1/4 cup olive oil, onion, red pepper flakes, garlic, oregano, parsley, and salt into a large pot and bring to a boil. Stir cooked scallops, shrimp, calamari, mussels in shells, and littleneck clams in shells into tomato mixture. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour.</li>

            <li>About 10 minutes before serving, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain and rinse pasta in hot water to prevent sticking. Serve seafood and sauce over pasta.</li>

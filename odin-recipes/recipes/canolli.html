    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"Ya gotta be kiddin' me" Tony would typically exclaim, practically without fail (roughly 85% of the 
            time), while laying his eyes on on the after-dinner dessert platter being promptly & switfly presented
            to him and his goons be Tony's sweating and terrified wife, all while he takes large drags of a dramatically 
            girthy cigar while condescendingly gazing. Regardless of what was consumed for dinner and regardless of its consistency, flavor, or degree of providing 
            a sensation of fullness, Tony's stomach always had room and his strong will always a desire and need to wash it 
            all down with a canolli - one possessing a delicately flaky shell which serves to provide a resting place for the 
            thick, rich, classic canolli filling.</p>  
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For the Shells:
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>

                    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>

                    <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

                    <li>3 tablespoons shortening</li>

                    <li>½ cup sweet Marsala wine</li>

                    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>

                    <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>

                    <li>1 egg</li>

                    <li>1 egg yolk</li>

                    <li>1 egg white</li>

                    <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For the Filling:
                <ul>
                    <li>1 (32 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>

                    <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>

                    <li>4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped (Optional)</li>

                    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest, or to taste</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make shells: Mix flour, sugar, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Cut in shortening until crumbly. Make a well in the center and add Marsala wine, water, vinegar, egg, and egg yolk. Mix with a fork until the dough becomes stiff, then finish kneading it by hand on a clean surface, adding a bit more water if needed for about 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Divide cannoli dough into three balls; flatten each one just enough to get through the pasta machine. Roll a ball of dough through successively thinner settings until you have reached the thinnest setting. Dust lightly with flour if necessary. Place the sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface. Using a cutter or large glass, cut out 4 to 5-inch circles. Dust the circles with a light coating of flour. This will help you later in removing the shells from the tubes. Roll dough around cannoli tubes, sealing the edge with a bit of egg white. Repeat with remaining dough balls.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry shells on the tubes in hot oil, a few at a time, until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Use tongs to turn as needed. Remove shells carefully using tongs, and place them on a cooling rack set over paper towels. Cool just long enough that you can handle the tubes, then carefully twist the tube to remove the shell. Using a tea towel may help you get a better grip. Wash or wipe off the tubes, and use them for more shells. Cooled shells can be placed in an airtight container and kept for up to 2 months. You should only fill them immediately or up to 1 hour before serving.</li>
            <li>Make filling: Mix ricotta cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl until well combined. Fold in chocolate and lemon zest. Transfer mixture into a pastry bag and pipe into shells, filling from the center to one end, then doing the same from the other side. Dust with additional confectioners' sugar to serve, if you like.</li>
        </ol>

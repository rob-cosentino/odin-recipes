    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sardinian ham is a traditional Italian cut of meat derived from the shoulder and neck of a pig.
            Amongst early Italian-American settlers it was referred to a capocollo and coppa for short, however, 
            when referred to by Tony or any of his confidants, henchmen, family, friends, acquantances, or anyone
            within his earshot, it is referred to as <strong><em>GABAGOOL</em></strong>. Referring to Sardinian 
            Ham as anything other than <em>gabagool</em>is simple permission to get roughed up by Tony - rumor 
            has it is that Tony laid a hand on his old native Italian grandmother for failing to abide by this sacred
            commandment. Ever have Gabagool on a <em>sandwich?</em> Tony has.</p>

                 </ul>
             </li>
         </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the hoagie buns in half lengthwise. Spread the mayonnaise on each bottom half. Dress the shredded lettuce with Italian dressing. Place the lettuce on the bottoms of the hoagie buns. Portion the gabagool into 4-ounce shingled mounds and fry them in a skillet until crispy on one side, about 5 minutes. Flip the gabagool over and add 1 ounce Pickled Peppers and 2 slices cheese to the top of each mound. Cook until the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Transfer the mounds to the bun bottoms. Spread 1 ounce Company Sauce on the top half of each hoagie bun and top the sandwiches.</li>
            <li>Pickled Banana Peppers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Slice the banana peppers 1/8-inch thick and set aside in a glass or plastic container with a lid. Add the vinegar, salt, sugar, garlic and bay leaf to a saucepot and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved, about 3 minutes, then remove from the heat. Let cool to room temperature, then pour over the peppers and let sit for at least 3 hours. (The longer they sit, the better they are.) They will hold in a refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. *Yields 1 pint*</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Company Sauce:
                <ul>
                    <li>Crack the eggs into a blender. Add the mustard, capers, vinegar, sugar, celery salt, salt, MSG and lemon juice. Cover the blender with the lid and turn to medium-high speed. Blend until incorporated. With the blender still running, turn the speed down to medium and remove the stopper in the lid. Slowly drizzle the oil into the mixture until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Will hold in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. *Yields 1 quart*</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
